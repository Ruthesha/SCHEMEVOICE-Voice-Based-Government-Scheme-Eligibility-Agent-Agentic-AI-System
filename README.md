SchemeVoice 🎙️
A Telugu Voice-Based Agentic System for Government Scheme Eligibility
SchemeVoice is an end-to-end voice-first, agentic AI system that helps users discover eligible government schemes through a natural Telugu conversation.
The system dynamically asks questions, reasons over user responses, checks eligibility, and speaks the results back to the user — all without rigid scripts.
